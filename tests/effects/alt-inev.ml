(* Property to be checked: if event P occurs infinitely often so does Ha *)
(* The original property described in their paper is
   G(P=>X (Walk U Ha1 / Run U Ha2))
   this can be expressed as the conjunction of the following properties:
    1. If P happens, then Ha1 or Ha2 happens eventually
    2. The next event after P is one of the events in {Ha1,Walk,Ha2,Run}
    3. After P and Walk happens, the next action is Walk or Ha1.
    4. After P and Run happens, the next action is Run or Ha2.
   The properties 2-4 are safety properties,
   which can be checked by plain MoCHi.
